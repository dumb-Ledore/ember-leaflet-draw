  Enable Deleting: a config property for the Draw Control component
</div>

<p>
  The default value for `enableDeleting` is `true`. This allows the most basic use-case to include the deletion controls out of the box.
  This property has been added to allow you to easily override the default value and turn deleting off.
  This shortcut allows you to get going with drawing in Leaflet without learning the API for the Leaflet Draw plugin.
</p>

<p>
  You can also turn off the ability to delete by using the pass-though `remove` property on the edit config options (see underlying API Docs <a href="https://leaflet.github.io/Leaflet.draw/docs/leaflet-draw-latest.html#editpolyoptions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>).
  It passes the object along as `options.edit` while instantiating the Draw Control.
  If you have set either the `remove` config to true or the shortcut `enableDeleting` is set to true, the outcome will be that the deletion controls are active (true).
</p>

<p>
  Notice below, the Delete button is missing from the Draw Control... this is due to setting the `enableDeleting` property to false.
